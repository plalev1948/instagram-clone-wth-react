An Instagram clone with React

Benefits for React:
-making your app in a component based way, where everything is a component and everything is really fast.
-if i change one part of the website, it's gonna change only this part of the site and it's not gonna refresh the whole site.
-speed and how eassilly and quickly you can put things together

With State it's how you use variables in React

Firebase gives you a real-time database.


I am creating a instagram clone and I have made it with react js and database
is cloud firestore, and using Cloud Storage for storing images.
